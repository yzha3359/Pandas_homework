# Pandas_homework
## This homework involves data cleaning and quantative analysis. Furthermore, using rolling statistics and Sharpe ratio to analysis portfolio combined. Lastly, custom portfolio analysis is conducted and re-run the risk analysis with custom portfolio to see how it compares to the others.
### Prepare the data
**Use Pandas to read the following CSV files as a DataFrame. Detect and remove null values.**
**Join `Whale Returns`, `Algorithmic Returns`, and the `S&P TSX 60 Returns` into a single DataFrame with columns for each portfolio's returns.**
### Conduct Quantitative Analysis
**Performance Analysis
Risk Analysis
Rolling Statistics
Exponentially Weighted Average**
### Sharpe Ratio
**Using the daily returns, calculate and visualize the Sharpe ratios using a bar plot**
### Custom portfolio
**Calculate the Annualized Standard Deviation.**
    1. Calculate and plot rolling `std` with a 21-day window.
    2. Calculate and plot the correlation.
    3. Calculate and plot the 60-day rolling beta for your portfolio compared to the S&P 60 TSX.
    4. Calculate the Sharpe ratios and generate a bar plot.
